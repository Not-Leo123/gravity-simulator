Here is a simple(ish) gravity simulator I made. It includes supernovas, binary systems, planets, black holes, and some cool-looking stars in the background. i have no idea if the run.sh script will work in windows if it doesn't let me know and i will fix it. 


enjoy (i will probibly add to it one day)
